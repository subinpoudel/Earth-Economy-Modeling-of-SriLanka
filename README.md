# Earth-Economy-Modeling-of-SriLanka
This is the final assignment of APEC 8601- Natural Resources Course. In this project I use the tools like GTAP-InVEST earth economy modeling to estimate the economic value of various ecosystem services to Sri-Lankan economy. I will also compute the global-local estimates of the influence of ecosystem services on the computable general equilibrium.
